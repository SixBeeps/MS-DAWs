# MS-DAWs
A DAW made entirely in C# in DOS

**Please Note (No pun intended)**
This is not the best approach at a DAW because, well, it's DOS, and I don't think DOS even supports mouse events, so, no piano roll :(

Thought I should mention [TheMonsterOfTheDeep](www.github.com/THeMonsterOfTheDeep) because he was the person to encourage me to post this on GitHub!
