# MS-DAWs
A DAW made entirely in C# with a DOS look.
Currently in v1.0.1

**Please Note (No pun intended)**
This is not the best approach at a DAW because, well, it's DOS, and I don't think DOS even supports mouse events, so, no piano roll :(

Thought I should mention [TheMonsterFromTheDeep](https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/) because he was the person to encourage me to post this on GitHub!
